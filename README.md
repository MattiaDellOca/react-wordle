# 📖 React Wordle

## 📃 Description
React Wordle is a simple recreation of the popular word-guessing game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), built using React. 
The idea behind this repository sparked after seeing this [coding interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xf4_Kx7azg&t=2616s) with the same challenge.

## 🕹️ How to Play
- Open the [page](https://MattiaDellOca.github.io/react-wordle/)
- Type your guesses using the keyboard.
- Press `Enter` to submit a guess.
- Use `Backspace` to delete the last character.
- The game provides feedback on each guess:
  - _Green_: Correct letter in the correct position.
  - _Yellow_: Correct letter in the wrong position.
  - _Gray_: Incorrect letter.

Only specific words will be accepted by the game. You can find the list [here](https://api.frontendexpert.io/api/fe/wordle-words).
